# Sentiment_Analysis

## Dataset: 
Large Movie Review Dataset [1] <br>
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification which provides more than 50,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and testing purpose along with unlabeled data for use as well. <br>

## Objective: 
To create pipelines for text classification/sentiment analysis using different machine learning algorithms and perform a comparative study to evaluate the performance of different models on the Large Movie Review Dataset [1] <br>

## Approach: 
A general process of applying algorithms for classification includes text pre-processing, feature selection, implementation of ML models and finally, evaluation of the model on the testing dataset. Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN and LSTM algorithms will be used to train the models and the performance of these models will be analyzed using the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F-score, recall, precision, and confusion matrix. Then, in order to determine which algorithm performs better than the others, these approaches will be compared. <br>
